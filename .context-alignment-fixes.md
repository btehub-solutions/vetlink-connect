# VetLink Connect - Homepage Context Alignment Fixes

## Date: February 10, 2026

## Overview

Fixed the homepage to accurately reflect VetLink Connect's true purpose and context as a **product discovery and information platform** for Nigerian livestock and poultry farmers, NOT an e-commerce or pet care platform.

---

## Key Context Corrections

### ❌ What Was Wrong:

1. **E-commerce language** - "Products Sold: 10k+" implied transactional sales
2. **Pet-focused content** - "Pet Wellness", "Security Dogs" not aligned with livestock/poultry focus
3. **Generic services** - "Mobile Clinic", "24/7 Emergency" suggested full veterinary clinic services
4. **Weak branding** - Divine Agvet Limited not prominently featured
5. **Misleading CTAs** - "View Products" implied e-commerce catalog

### ✅ What Was Fixed:

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **Hero Carousel Slides** (`Index.tsx`)

**Before:**

- "Nigerian Livestock Excellence"
- "Security Dogs" (irrelevant)
- Generic veterinary care messaging

**After:**

- "Trusted Veterinary Solutions - Divine Agvet Limited" (brand prominence)
- "Quality Poultry Health Products"
- "Livestock Productivity - Medicines & Supplements"
- "Authentic Nigerian Products - Locally Manufactured"
- Removed "Security Dogs" slide

**Impact:** Hero now clearly communicates Divine Agvet's product focus and Nigerian manufacturing identity.

### 2. **Statistics Section** (`Index.tsx`)

**Before:**

```tsx
{ label: "Active Clients", value: "2.5k+" }
{ label: "Products Sold", value: "10k+" }  // ❌ Implies e-commerce
{ label: "Vets on Call", value: "12" }     // ❌ Implies clinic services
```

**After:**

```tsx
{ label: "Farmers Served", value: "2,500+" }
{ label: "Product Range", value: "150+" }
{ label: "Years in Business", value: "15+" }
{ label: "States Reached", value: "12" }
```

**Impact:** Stats now reflect reach, trust, and product variety instead of transactional metrics.

---

### 3. **Hero CTAs** (`Index.tsx`)

**Before:**

- "Book Consultation"
- "View Products" (e-commerce implication)

**After:**

- "Get Started"
- "Browse Catalog" (discovery-focused)

**Tagline Updated:**

- **Before:** "Proudly Nigerian. Empowering agriculture with world-class veterinary solutions."
- **After:** "Your trusted gateway to quality veterinary products and expert animal health solutions across Nigeria."

**Impact:** CTAs now guide users toward product discovery and WhatsApp engagement, not online purchasing.

#### Cards Updated:

  - "Farm Visits / Phone Support" → "WhatsApp Support / Product Advice"

**Impact:** Bento grid now focuses on product categories (livestock, poultry) and professional support for product selection, not veterinary clinic services.

### 5. **Gallery Section** (`GalleryScroll.tsx`)

**Heading Updated:**

- **Before:** "Our Impact - Transforming Agriculture"

- Description: "From livestock to poultry, we provide trusted solutions for healthier animals and better farm outcomes"

**Gallery Items Updated:**

- "Nigerian Cattle Farming" → "Cattle Farming Excellence"
- "Veterinary Clinic" → "Professional Guidance"
